### Why do we not need more .html pages in a multi-page React app?
Instead of pages you use a router to render different pages on the index.html, since React only uses one html page.


### If we wanted a component to show up on every page, where would we put it and why?
Inside the <BrowserRouter />, outside a <Route />
  
### What does routing do with the components that were rendered when a new route is requested
Unmounts the component

### What does props.children contain?
Contains whatever you include between the opening and closing tags when invoking a component

### How do useState() and this.setState() differ?
this.setState() merges the state where as useState() rewrites the state


### Vocabulary Terms
State Hook - Hooks are functions that let you “hook into” React state and lifecycle features from function components.
Mounting and Un-Mounting - How you create a component in the DOM (mounting) and how you delete a component in the DOM (un-mounting)
