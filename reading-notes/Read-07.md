- The table tag is used to create forms using html
- HTML tables are similiar to tables that you would create in a word document or excel file
- After the table tag is used, you would continue creating the table using rows which use the tr (table row) tags
- td (table data) and th (table heading) tags are used to insert information within a table or serve as a column heading. th and td tags also essentially act as the means to add a column. not all rows must have the same amount of td tags as not every row must have the same amount of columns, but an uneven amount of tags will column sizes
- rowspan and colspan can be used to make cells span more than one row or column

**example table format**

&lt;table&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;

&lt;th&gt; Apples &lt;/th&gt;

&lt;th&gt; Oranges &lt;/th&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;

&lt;th&gt; 10 &lt;/th&gt;

&lt;th&gt; 5 &lt;/th&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;/table&gt;
