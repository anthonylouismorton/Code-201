### What is the principle advantage of Redux Toolkit
 it easier to write good Redux applications and speeds up development, by baking in our recommended best practices, providing good default behaviors, catching mistakes, and allowing you to write simpler code

### Vocabulary Terms
redux toolkit slices - a higher order function that accepts an initial state, an object full of reducer functions and a slice name. It automatically generates action creators and action types that correspond to the reducers and state.
namespace - a set of signs (names) that are used to identify and refer to objects of various kinds. A namespace ensures that all of a given set of objects have unique names so that they can be easily identified.
