### Name 3 advantages to Test Driven Development
1.  Code is easier to maintain
2.  Less debugging
3.  Design becomes more modular

### What is one downside of Test Driven Development
1. Slow developmental process

### In what case would you need to use beforeEach() or afterEach() in a test suite?

### What’s the primary difference between ES6 Classes and Constructor/Prototype Classes?
ES6 class is a template used to create objects while a prototype class is an object instance

### Why REST?
REST uses less bandwidth, is easy to use, and is flexible

### Vocabulary Terms
**functional programming**: programming paradigm designed to handle pure mathematical functions
**object-oriented programming (OOP)**: programming based on objects and classes to allow for simple reusable code
**class**: template for creating objects
**super**: keyword used to call the constructor of its parent
**this**: keyword used to refer something to its object
**Test-Driven Development (TDD)**: using tests to drive the development of software
**Jest**: used for creating, running, and structuring tests
**Continuous Integration (CI)**: Continually adding new code or features to a shared codebase
**Rest**: representational state transfer
**Data Model**: Data modeling is the process of creating a visual representation of either a whole information system or parts of it to communicate connections between data points and structures.
