- Images can be resized like other elements. Height and width properties can be added when attempting to resize multiple images on a page to be the same dimensions
- Images can be aligned horizontally and vertically
- Background images can also be applied to a page. Background images can appear behind all elements on a page if it is applied to the body/main or they can appear behind other elements held within a specific container such as a div
- Background images can be tiled, which is when the image appears multiple times in the background
- Image sprites are used so that a webpage only has to load an image once. This is helpful when the same image is used multiple times on a page
- Other CSS styling can be used on images such as round corners, blur, transparency, gradient, etc.

### Chapter 19: “Practical Information” (476-492)
- Search engine optimization(SEO) is the practice of designing a page so that it is more visible on search engines. Search engines consider what appears on your page and what other pages on the internet link to yours. SEO is divided into two major techniques:
  *On-Page Techniques*
  - On-page techniques refer to the method in which you can improve your page to appear on search engines
  - Using keywords on your HTML that people search for on Google will increase your visibility
  - Search engines rely on the text that appears on your webpage
  - using the alt attribute in pictures to add keywords to an image will increase page visibility
  
  *Off-Page Techniques
  - Off-page techniques focus on having other pages link to yours. The more pages that link your page, the higher your search engine visibility will be
  - It is also important that the external page linking to yours has some relevance to your page
  - Text within an anchor tag should include a keyword to increase visibility rather than the text having your website name

- Page analytics are important in understanding how many people are visiting your page. They can also tell you how many unique visitors you have, what people are looking at on your page, and other important details
- In order to launch a page on the internet you must have a domain name (website address) and a web hosting service such as Godaddy.com
- FTP services is a third-party service that can help you transfer files and images from your local computer/server to a web hosting site/server
