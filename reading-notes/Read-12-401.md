### Vocabulary Terms
Observer Pattern - software design pattern in which an object, named the subject, maintains a list of its dependents, called observers, and notifies them automatically of any state changes, usually by calling one of their methods
Listener - listens for an event to occur
Event Handler - is a callback routine that operates asynchronously and handles inputs received into a program.
Event-Driven Programming - programming paradigm in which the flow of the program is determined by events such as user actions (mouse clicks, key presses), sensor outputs, or message passing from other programs or threads
Event Loop - programming construct or design pattern that waits for and dispatches events or messages in a program
Event Queue - the repository where events from an application are stored prior to being processed by the receiver
Call Stack - a stack data structure that stores information about the active subroutines of a computer program
Emit/Raise/Trigger - emits a channel and a payload, a trigger is an action in which event listeners are listening on
Subscribe - list/react events on event emitters
database - a structured set of data in a collection
### Are all callback functions considered to be Asynchronous? Why or Why Not?
Callback functions are not asynchronous. Callback functions are functions that are passed in as an argument. However, they can be used for asynchronous purposes. Callback functions are run when the function that uses them as a parameter are called and are not part of a queue.
