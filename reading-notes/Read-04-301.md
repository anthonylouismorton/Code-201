### React Docs - Forms
1. What is a ‘Controlled Component’?
- A controlled form is an input form element whose value is controlled by React
2. Should we wait to store the user's responses from the form into state when they submit the form OR should we update the state with their responses as soon as they enter them? Why.
- You want to store the responses as soon as the user enters them. This allows you to provide instant feedback to the user.
3. How do we target what the user is entering if we have an event handler on an input field?
- Use event.target.value

### The Conditional (Ternary) Operator Explained
1. Why would we use a ternary operator?
- The conditional operator allows you to simplify code, so that you do not have to create an if/else statement.
2. Rewrite the following statement using a ternary statement:
 > if(x===y){
 > console.log(true);
  > } else {
 > console.log(false);
 >  }
 >  console.log(x === y ? true : false)
