### Understanding the JavaScript Call Stack
1. What is a ‘call’?
- A call is a data structure that temporarily stores and manages function invocation using the Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle

2. How many ‘calls’ can happen at once?
- One

What does LIFO mean?
- LIFO means Last in, First Out. This means that the last function that was received by the stack is the first function returned when the stack returns

3. Draw an example of a call stack and the functions that would need to be invoked to generate that call stack.

4. What causes a Stack Overflow?
- A Stack Overflow occurs when a function calls itself without having an exit point, which is known as a recursive function

### JavaScript error messages
1. What is a ‘reference error’?
- Occurs when you use a variable that has not been declared

2. What is a ‘syntax error’?
- When you use improper syntax such as forgetting braces when you are making a function

3. What is a ‘range error’?
- Occurs when you try to give an object an invalid length

4. What is a ‘type error’?
- Occurs when the types you are trying to access are incompatible

5. What is a breakpoint?
- Stops your code from running where you set your breakpoint, so you may determine the error before your code continues running

What does the word ‘debugger’ do in your code?
- A debugger works as a breakpoint
