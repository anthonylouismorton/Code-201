2. What is a pure function and how do we know if something is a pure function?
- It returns the same results if given the same argument and does not cause any observable side effects

3. What are the benefits of a pure function?
- Code is easier to test

4. What is immutability?
- Immutability means that the state cannot be changed once it is created

5. What is Referential transparency?
- If a function yields the same results given the same input, it is referentially transparent
