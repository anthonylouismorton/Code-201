A PUT will update an entire data resource if something already exists. A PATCH will only do a partial update on an already existing resource

### Provide links to 3 services or tools that allow you to “mock” an API for development like `json-server`
1. https://designer.mocky.io/
2. http://wiremock.org/docs/api/
3. https://mockoon.com/

### Compare and contrast Swagger and APIDoc.js 1 Which HTTP status codes should be sent with each type of (un)successful API call?
Both offer free services
**401 Unauthorized:** You have not authenticated yourself to the API
**400 Bad Request:** Something in your request was not right and the API does not recognize it as good
**429 Too Many Requests:** You have asked for too many requests from the API. Some APIs have limits on requests whether it be total or during a certain time duration

- REST is easier to use and more flexible
- REST is faster than SOAP
