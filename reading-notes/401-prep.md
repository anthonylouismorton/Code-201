## Prep-reading

### Solving Problems
- Steps to solving an algorithm type programming problem
1. Read the problem completely twice.
2. Solve the problem manually with 3 sets of sample data.
3. Optimize the manual steps.
4. Write the manual steps as comments or pseudo-code.
5. Replace the comments or pseudo-code with real code.
6. Optimize the real code.
- have confidence in the process
- 70% of the time needed to solve a coding problem should be spent on problem-solving and not coding
- "divide and conquer" for problems that have multiple steps

### Act like you make $1000/hr
- People spend too much time being unproductive
- Being focused is more important than being busy
- Being busy is a sign of mental laziness
- People that are really successful say no to almost everything
- Treat your time as it is worth $1,000/hour and you will be more productive and focused on things that matter more to your mission

### How to think like a programmer
- The best way to solve problems is to have a framework and to practice it
- Steps to problem-solving:
1. Understand: You should understand exactly what is being asked and you should be able to explain the problem in plain English
2. Plan: Don't start solving the problem until you have a plan
3. Divide: Break a problem down into sub-problems then solve each sub-problem one by one
4. Stuck?: Debug by going step by step through a solution to find the problem; reassess by looking at the problem from another perspective; research by searching for the solution to your problem
- Practice problem solving as you won't be good at it right away

### 5 Whys
- 5 Whys was originally created by Sakichi Toyoda who was the founder of Toyota Industries
- 5 Whys is a simple technique where you ask why 5 times until you find the root cause of a problem
- 5 Whys can be used for multiple problems such as troubleshooting, quality improvement, and problem-solving
- How to use the 5 whys:
1. Assemble a Team: gather people familiar with the problem you are trying to solve
2. Define the Problem: Write a clear problem statement on what problem you are attempting to solve
3. Ask the First "Why?": Ask your team why the problem is occurring. Answers should be factual and you should write down everyone's responses
4. Ask "Why?" Four More Times: This should be a repeat of step 3 and should be a response to the answer previously recorded
5. Know When to Stop: You should stop when asking why has no more useful responses
6. Address the Root Cause(s): A plan should be established to address the root cause
7. Monitor Your Measures: Track what measures you implemented to address a root cause. This could require amending your countermeasures or performing the 5 Whys again
