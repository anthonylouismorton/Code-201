### Chapter 5: “Images” (pp.94-125)

- &lt;img&gt; tags are used to insert images on a webpage
- A source (src) attribute is required to indicate the source of an image. Images can have URLs (website) or they can be found locally on a computer or server (requires file path)
- Images can be resized and other CSS styling can be applied such as a border
- A variety of image formats can be used such as jpeg, jpg, gif, png, and many more

*Example image element linked to picture found on a webpage*

### JPEG vs PNG vs GIF

- There are hundreds of image formats each with their own specific use case
- Jpeg format is best used for images with natural scenery or photogrpthy and where color variation is smooth
- PNG format is best used for images that have text and objects with sharp contrast or require transparency
- GIF format is used for images that have animation
