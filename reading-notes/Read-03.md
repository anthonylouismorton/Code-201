## ***Duckett HTML Book***

### HTML Chapter 3: “Lists” (p.62-73)

- Three types of lists: Ordered, Unordered, and Definition
- Ordered lists are displayed using a numerical system
- Unordered lists are not numbered, but use a bullet style system
- Definition lists

**Ordered List Syntax:** 

&lt;OL&gt;

  &lt;LI&gt; Candy &lt;/LI&gt;
  
  &lt;LI&gt; Soda &lt;/LI&gt;
  
  &lt;LI&gt; Popcorn &lt;/LI&gt;
  
&lt;/OL&gt;

**Output:**
1. Candy
2. Soda
3. Popcorn

**Unordered List Syntax:** 

&lt;UL&gt;

  &lt;LI&gt; Candy &lt;/LI&gt;
  
  &lt;LI&gt; Soda &lt;/LI&gt;
  
  &lt;LI&gt; Popcorn &lt;/LI&gt;
  
&lt;/UL&gt;

**Output:**
- Candy
- Soda
- Popcorn

### Chapter 13: “Boxes” (pp.300-329)
- html 5 has additional elements not previously used in earlier versions
- div tags were originally used in addition to the common html tags (body, html, title, head) to identify separate elements. This could make styling difficult as assigning a class or id to every div would now be necessary if you wanted different styling for each div tag
- article, aside, header, footer, section, hgroup, figure, figcaption, and div are tags supported by html5
- JS is needed to display html5 elements properly on older browsers
- new elements provide "cleaner" code

### HTML Chapter 18: “Process & Design” (pp.452-475)
- It is important to understand your target audience, the goal of your site, how often it will be visited, and what information should be displayed on the site
- A diagram should be used to determine the layout of the site. Card sorting can be used to determine what information is displayed on what page
- A wireframe is used as a simple sketch of a page. It would display where information would be located and how much space it would take up
- visual hierarchy:
> "refers to the order in which your eyes perceive what they see. It is created by adding visual contrast between the items being displayed (pp. 468)."
Size, color, and style are means in which a designer can draw attention to key information
- grouping and similarity refers to grouping related pieces of information together. Proximity, closure, continuance, white space, color, and borders are some ways to accomplish this goal
- Site navigation is important in assisting people in finding out where they need to go. The following principles are associated with a good navigation:
  1. Concise - quick and easy to read. Limit the number of options to less than 8. Dropdowns could be used to add more options, but keeps choices organized
  2. clear - a single descriptive word (occasionally two) that tells a user what they will see when they click on your navigation
  3. selective - navigation should only reflect the sections of the webpage
  4. context - a user should know where they are on a website. A different color on the nav bar can be used to annotate where on the site a user currently is
  5. interactive - navigation items should be large enough to click and the cursor should change when hovered to inform the user something is clickable
  6. consistent - the primary navigation should be displayed exactly the same on each page, but secondary navigation can change
