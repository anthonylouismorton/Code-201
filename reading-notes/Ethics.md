Programmers and even members of other job sectors often face ethic dilemmas during their daily work.
In programming general ehtic principles include: Contribute to society and to human well-being, acknowledging that all people are stakeholders in computing.; 
Avoid harm; Be honest and trustworthy; Be fair and take action not to discriminate.; 
Be fair and take action not to discriminate.; 
Be fair and take action not to discriminate. 
These principles can often conflict with businesses, because businesses are not always ehical and mainly care about profits. 
Programmers should think about thier ethical duties when given an assignment and conform to them.  
I think these articles fall in line with what I already suspected. Businesses do not care about ethics and most likely at some point in a programmer's life they will be asked to do something unethical.
