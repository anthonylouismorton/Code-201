What are the key strengths of each person on the team?

- George: GitHub and Enjoys CSS (not the best in own opinion)
- Andrea: CSS, HTML
- Anthony: JS

- Zack: JS HTML

How can you best utilize these strengths in the execution of your project?

- Andrea: Tool proficiency, networking, openness
- Anthony: curiosity, ambition, confidence, networking, tool proficiency, collaboration, prioritization
- Roop: Innovation, Technical, Networking, Ambition and Initiative

- one day at a time
- 10am morning meetings to discuss plans for the day and how the previous day went
- Mix of paired progammming and single programming
- Use Trello to assist in organization and assigning tasks


Conflict Plan
Your team should agree on a process for handing disagreements, should they arise. It is better to have a plan in place ahead of time so you can all refer back to it when necessary.

Describe at least:

What will be your group’s process to resolve conflict, when it arises?
- George is God and will decide who is right
- Come to a group consensus on the direction to go with a conflict

What will your team do if one person is taking over the project and not letting the other members contribute?
- Cry to Sara and tell her George is being a benevolent God
- Have a group meeting to discuss the need for equal voicing of opinions, recommendations, etc.


How will you approach each other and the challenges of the project knowing that it is impossible for all members to be at the exact same place in understanding and skill level?
- Be kind to one another and take the time to mentor those that need help
- Used paired progamming to help those of "lesser" skill
- Foster those ideas from the lessed skill people, so that they are still contributing to the team even if it isn't from a technical aspect

How will you raise concerns to members who are not adequately contributing?
- Send them to King George IV (I've seen his hands, they are really big)
- Confront the person personally (one on one). Maybe they don't understand they are not adequately contributing and just need a little bump

How and when will you escalate the conflict if your resolution attempts are unsuccessful?
- If the issue still peresits, have a group meeting to discuss the issue with the offending party
- If all else fails, get faculty involved
