### Write the following steps in the correct order:
Register your application to get a client_id and client_secret
Ask the client if they want to sign in via a third party
Redirect to a third party authentication endpoint
Receive authorization code

Receive access token
Make a request to a third-party API endpoint

Authentication Endpoint - security mechanism designed to ensure only authorized devices can connect to a given place
Access Token Endpoint - Where apps make a request to get a special access token for a user
API Endpoint - A point which an API connects with a software endpoint
Authorization Code - A temporary code that the client will exchange for an access token
Access Token - a tiny piece of code that contains a large amount of data. Information about the user, permissions, groups, and timeframes is embedded within one token that passes from a server to a user's device.
