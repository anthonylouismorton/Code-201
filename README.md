### Component Based Architecture
1. What is a component
> A component is a modular, portable, replaceable, and reusable set of well-defined functionality that encapsulates its implementation and exporting it as a higher-level interface.
> A component is a software object, intended to interact with other components, encapsulating certain functionality or a set of functionalities. It has an obviously defined interface and conforms to a recommended behavior common to all components within an architecture.

2. What are the characteristics of a component?
- Reusability: designed to be reused in different situations in different applications
- Replaceable: Can be replaced with other similar components
- Not context-specific: components are designed to work in multiple contexts
- Extensible: Can be extended from existing components to have a new behavior
- Encapsulated: a component depicts the interface and allows users to call its functionality, but does not expose internal details of it
- Independent: Designed to nave minimal reliance on other components

3. What are the advantages of using component based architecture?
- ease of deployment, reduced cost, reusable, modification of technical complexity, reliability, system maintenance and evolution, and independent

### What is props and How to Use it in React
1. What is props short for?
- Props is short for properties

2. How are props used in React?
- Props are used for passing data from one component to another

3. What is the flow of props?
- props is a uni-directional flow meaning that data is being passed one way from parent to child
